A Simple Linear Regression Implementation

Introduction

This code implements a simple linear regression model from scratch using Python. It provides the following functionalities:

Custom r2_score function to calculate the R-squared value (coefficient of determination), a common metric for evaluating the goodness of fit of a linear regression model.
LinearRegression class for performing linear regression:
Configurable learning rate and number of iterations for fitting the model.
fit method to train the model on a given dataset.
predict method to make predictions on new data points using the learned weights and bias.
Testing script demonstrating usage:
Creates synthetic data using sklearn's make_regression function.
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Instantiates the LinearRegression model and fits it to the training data.
Makes predictions on the testing data and calculates the mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared score.
Visualizes the training and testing data points along with the predicted regression line.
Usage

Import and initialize:

Python
import LinearRegression

model = LinearRegression.LinearRegression(learning_rate=0.01, num_iterations=1000)
Use code with caution.
Fit the model on your training data:

Python
X_train, y_train = ...  # Your training data inputs and outputs
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Use code with caution.
Make predictions on new data:

Python
X_new = ...  # New data points
predictions = model.predict(X_new)
Use code with caution.
Customization

Adjust the learning_rate and num_iterations in the LinearRegression constructor to control the learning process and convergence.
Implement additional metrics or methods in the class as needed.
Dependencies

This code requires the following Python libraries:

numpy for numerical computations
sklearn for creating synthetic data (used in the testing script)
matplotlib.pyplot for data visualization (used in the testing script)
Additional Notes

This implementation provides a basic linear regression model. For more advanced applications, consider using established libraries like scikit-learn's LinearRegression class.
The choice of learning rate and number of iterations can significantly impact the model's performance. Tune these parameters carefully based on your dataset and objectives.
For real-world use cases, you'll likely need to pre-process and clean your data before applying linear regression.
